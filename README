Hi there.

this is an attempt to make an updater for chromium, mainly for windows and for mac,
because most linuxoid systems have their own package managers with up-to-date builds of chromium.

this program pulls the most recent(or most stable) build from
http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-continuous/index.html

and unpacks it to a location of your choice,
(backing up older versions).
