Hi there.
this is an attempt to make an updater for chromium for Windows and Mac OS X.
Linux/Unix will not be supported, because most linuxoid systems have their own package manager with up-to-date builds of chromium.

At the moment this program pulls the most recent build from http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-continuous/index.html 
and unpacks it to the windows program files folder respectively the Mac Applications folder.

Full Mac support is coming soon-ish, when we have managed it, to copy files into the Applications folder ... ;-)

When the main development is done, we'll provide finished builds here without all the debugging code. And maybe an .app for Mac OS X

Regards,
